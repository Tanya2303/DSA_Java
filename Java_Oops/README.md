## ENCAPSULATION
Encapsulation is one of the four fundamental Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It is a mechanism that binds the data (attributes) and methods (functions) together in a single unit, known as a class. 
Encapsulation restricts direct access to some of the object's components and can prevent the accidental modification of data.
It is a protective barrier that keeps the data safe within the object and prevents outside code from directly accessing it. 

ENCAPSULATION can be defined as the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, restricting direct access to some of the object's components. 
It is a protective barrier that keeps the data safe within the object and prevents outside code from directly accessing it.
In the above code, we have used encapsulation to restrict direct access to the Pen's color and tipSize attributes by using methods to set and get their values. 
This ensures that the internal state of the Pen object can only be modified through its methods, maintaining control over how the data is accessed and modified.
In the Getters_Setters.java, we have used encapsulation to restrict direct access to the Pen's color and tipSize attributes by using methods to set and get their values. 
This ensures that the internal state of the Pen object can only be modified through its methods, maintaining control over how the data is accessed and modified.
