// Bitwise operators are used to perform bit-level operations on binary numbers. They operate on individual bits of integer types (like int, long, etc.) and are commonly used in low-level programming, graphics programming, and performance optimization. Here are the basic bitwise operators in Java:
// 1. AND (&): The AND operator takes two bits and performs a logical AND operation. The result is 1 if both bits are 1; otherwise, it is 0.
// 2. OR (|): The OR operator takes two bits and performs a logical OR operation. The result is 1 if at least one of the bits is 1; otherwise, it is 0.
// 3. XOR (^): The XOR operator takes two bits and performs a logical exclusive OR operation. The result is 1 if the bits are different; otherwise, it is 0.
// 4. NOT (~): The NOT operator is a unary operator that flips the bits of its operand. It changes 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s.
// 5. Left Shift (<<): The left shift operator shifts the bits of its operand to the left by a specified number of positions. It fills the rightmost bits with 0s.
//  6. Right Shift (>>): The right shift operator shifts the bits of its operand to the right by a specified number of positions. It fills the leftmost bits with the sign bit (0 for positive numbers and 1 for negative numbers).
